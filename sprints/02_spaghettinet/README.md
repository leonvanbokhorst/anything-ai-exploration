# Sprint 2: Operation Spaghettinet - A Wiggly Web of Noodle Neurons

## Sprint Goal:

To invent, prototype, and evaluate a completely new "Spaghettinet" neural architecture that mimics tangled spaghetti connectivity, exploring its viability and humorously juxtaposing culinary chaos with deep learning magic.

## Tasks / Learning Objectives:

1. [x] Research Spaghetti Connectivity:

   - Dive into network connectivity patterns (dense vs sparse, random graphs).
   - Brainstorm how to encode "noodle-like" random wiring as a neural layer.

2. [x] Design the Spaghettinet Layer:

   - Define the mathematical formulation for a "Spaghettinet" layer.
   - Sketch the PyTorch `SpaghettiLayer(nn.Module)` API.

3. [x] Implement Prototype:

   - Write the `SpaghettiLayer` in `code/spaghettinet.py`.
   - Integrate it into a minimal feedforward network.

4. [x] Train & Test:

   - Use a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) for initial experiments.
   - Record training curves and compare against a baseline dense network.

5. [x] Analyze & Evaluate:

   - Evaluate accuracy vs. spaghetti weirdness (e.g., entropy or sparsity of connectivity).
   - Visualize the random noodle graph structure.

6. [x] Documentation & Results:
   - Write up the design and findings in `docs/`.
   - Save the code in `code/`, results in `results/`.
   - Generate playful network diagrams and sample outputs.

## Definition of Done:

- [x] The `SpaghettiLayer` is implemented and tested.
- [x] The prototype network trains without errors.
- [x] Baseline comparison metrics are collected.
- [x] Documentation and visualizations are complete.
