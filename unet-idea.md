# UNet on WSL

Short answer: absolutely. WSL 2 has had native CUDA pass‑through for a while now, and Microsoft’s current Windows 11 (23H2 +) plus NVIDIA’s recent “Game Ready / Studio” driver line (555 series or newer) expose your RTX 4090 straight into an Ubuntu‑on‑WSL session. Once the driver is in place you’ll see the card inside the distro with a regular `nvidia‑smi`; the CUDA 12.x libraries that ship with PyTorch wheels do the rest, so you rarely need a full `cuda‑toolkit` unless you plan to compile custom ops. citeturn0search0turn0search4turn0search1  

Inside WSL just grab a recent Python (3.10–3.12), `pip install torch==2.4.0+cu125 torchvision` (or use the nightly if you want the very latest compiler back‑ends), launch Python and check `torch.cuda.is_available()`—if it’s `False`, nine times out of ten it’s a driver / wheel mismatch, so downgrading one step or switching between `cu118`, `cu121`, and `cu125` wheels usually clears the fog. When someone hit that exact snag last year, rolling the driver back a single minor revision fixed it on the spot. citeturn2search0  

A bare‑bones UNet proof‑of‑concept in PyTorch looks like this (pad‑duplication instead of crop‑concat keeps the code minimal and plays nicely with torch.compile):

```python
import torch, torch.nn as nn, torch.nn.functional as F

def CBR(in_c, out_c):              # conv‑batch‑relu block
    return nn.Sequential(
        nn.Conv2d(in_c, out_c, 3, padding=1, bias=False),
        nn.BatchNorm2d(out_c),
        nn.ReLU(inplace=True))

class UNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, chs=(3,64,128,256,512,1024)):
        super().__init__()
        self.down = nn.ModuleList([CBR(chs[i], chs[i+1]) for i in range(len(chs)-1)])
        self.up   = nn.ModuleList([CBR(chs[i+1]+chs[i], chs[i]) for i in reversed(range(len(chs)-1))])

    def forward(self, x):
        enc = []
        for block in self.down[:-1]:
            x = block(x); enc.append(x); x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = self.down[-1](x)
        for block, skip in zip(self.up, reversed(enc)):
            x = F.interpolate(x, scale_factor=2, mode='nearest')
            x = block(torch.cat([x, skip], 1))
        return x

device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
model  = torch.compile(UNet().to(device))   # PyTorch 2.x dynamo/inductor
dummy  = torch.randn(2,3,256,256, device=device)
out    = model(dummy)
print(out.shape)
```

The script consumes only a few hundred megabytes on a 4090, so you can scale the channels up or push image size to 1024² and still sit well below the 24 GB ceiling.  

Performance notes to keep in the back of your mind while you tinker: in WSL 2 the GPU sees full PCIe bandwidth, but host–guest memory mapping adds a couple of microseconds of latency; for segmentation experiments it’s negligible, yet you’ll squeeze extra throughput by setting `export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:64` before training, flipping AMP with `torch.autocast`, and letting `torch.compile` fuse kernels. Watch VRAM fragmentation during long runs—rare in 12.x libs, but if you notice it, `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.95)` reins WSL’s unified memory back in.

So yes, your Ada‑powered box is more than ready. The interesting question is what you’d like the PoC to prove: pixel‑wise segmentation of medical scans, diffusion‑style image‑to‑image, or maybe experimenting with attention‑augmented UNets such as the UNet++ or Swin‑UNet hybrids? Let me know where you want to poke next and we can push the envelope a bit.

# First nudge

Make Windows do its share. Update to the latest Studio/Game‑Ready driver (anything in the 55x series or newer is CUDA‑12‑ready) and verify that `nvidia-smi` runs from PowerShell. Then launch Ubuntu in WSL 2, run `nvidia-smi` again; identical read‑out means the pass‑through handshake succeeded. Microsoft’s February‑2025 “Enable CUDA on WSL” doc still reads like a checklist if you want reassurance. 

Inside the distro I’d start a clean virtualenv (or poetry project) on Python 3.12, `pip install torch==2.6.0+cu126 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126` and confirm `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `True`. That wheel ships its own CUDA runtime, so mismatching system toolkits won’t bite you. PyTorch 2.6 dropped official conda wheels, so pip is the path of least resistance. citeturn7view0turn13view0  

A ten‑line smoke test helps the nerves:

```python
import torch, torch.nn as nn
x = torch.randn(8,3,128,128, device='cuda')
m = torch.nn.Conv2d(3,8,3).cuda()
y = m(x)
print(y.shape)
```

If that prints `torch.Size([8, 8, 126, 126])` you’re cleared for take‑off.

The PoC itself can stay lean. Grab the UNet skeleton I dropped earlier, wrap it in `torch.compile`, keep image crops at 256², and hook up a single‑GPU training loop:

```python
opt   = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-4)
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

for img, mask in loader:                     # img Bx3xHxW, mask BxCxHxW
    with torch.autocast('cuda'):
        logits = model(img.cuda())
        loss   = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, mask.cuda())
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(opt); opt.zero_grad()
    scaler.update()
```

For a fast‑moving dataset try the Oxford‑IIIT Pet images—180 MB, PNG masks included, perfect for segmentation demos. Two epochs with batch‑size 8 on the 4090 should converge into recognisable outlines in under ten minutes. When the VRAM graph wiggles above 10 GB, export `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:64` before python; that allocator flag curbs fragmentation and keeps long runs stable. The variable is now documented right in the CUDA semantics page, so no need to sift forum threads any more. citeturn10view0  

Once the vanilla UNet feels too vanilla, swap the final block for a diffusion‑style residual, or drop a Swin transformer in the bottleneck. The 4090 has room for those experiments, and torch.compile will still fuse most ops. If you get the itch to scale to 1024² inputs, checkpoint every down‑block to stay under 24 GB—or let me show you how to sprinkle LoRA adapters so you can fine‑tune a pre‑trained UNet++ in a coffee‑break.

Your move: what do you actually want this PoC to demonstrate—raw segmentation accuracy, diffusion‑grade image‑to‑image tricks, or a playground for attachment‑theory visualisations? Push me in a direction and I’ll keep the guard‑rails just wide enough for you to drift a bit 😉

# attachment theory 

Right, attachment theory it is—let’s get the GPU to paint some feelings.

First imagine what “attachment” looks like on screen.  In the classic parent‑infant clips researchers watch for proximity seeking, mutual gaze, synchronised motion and that tiny shoulder‑drop when the baby relaxes in secure contact.  All of those cues are visible to a camera, so your pipeline can start exactly there: cut a short interaction video into frames, run a pose‑estimator to grab skeletons plus face‑boxes, then fuse the key‑points into simple social‑signals—distance between torsos, gaze vector overlap, tempo of approach/withdrawal.  A public pose model (think MoveNet or the newer SMPL‑X based Motion‑X weights) is fast enough on the 4090 to process real‑time, so you can iterate while the coffee’s still warm.  If you’d rather stand on the shoulders of people already coding babies, skim the mother‑infant observational tooling in the medical‑psychology papers; they spell out the heuristics psychologists score by hand, which makes feature engineering almost unfairly easy. citeturn0search8turn0search4  

Once the raw cues are streaming you can translate them into colours and shapes.  A UNet like the one we built can segment each person, giving you per‑pixel masks; paint mum in cool tones, infant in warm ones, and let the area of overlap morph on‑screen as they cuddle or recoil.  Overlay a soft‑body “safety bubble” whose radius shrinks when mutual gaze locks and grows when avoidance spikes, and you have a living graphic that breathes with the dyad.  I like to push the effect one layer further: feed the temporal series of cues into a tiny GRU that predicts the probability of secure vs anxious vs avoidant state, then drive a diffusion model’s text prompt in real time—“gentle pastel scene of calm closeness” when security is high, sliding toward “fragmented, high‑contrast collage” as anxiety rises.  Watching the artwork shift while you replay the footage is a goose‑bump moment; students suddenly *see* what attachment means.  The Motion‑X style skeletons offer plenty of joints to keep that GRU happy with minimal training effort. citeturn0search1turn0search5  

On the engineering side nothing changes: PyTorch 2.6, CUDA 12.6, WSL‑2, the same UNet core, plus a pip install of MediaPipe or OpenPose for key‑points and `diffusers` for Stable‑Diffusion or SD‑Turbo.  The 4090 renders a 512² diffusion frame in under a second—fast enough for near‑live feedback if you decimate your video to 5 fps.  The only wrinkle is VRAM juggling when you want both pose and diffusion at once, so fire them in separate CUDA streams or checkpoint the UNet’s activations; the allocator flag we discussed keeps fragmentation at bay.  

I’m itching to know: are you picturing this as a research demo for students, a therapeutic mirror for parents, or something more artsy—maybe a concert‑visuals patch for your modular synth rig? 

# Artsy

For the artsy route: picture the attachment signals not as tidy graphs but as a paint palette. Let proximity modulate brush size, mutual gaze tilt the hue wheel, regulation vs. dysregulation drive texture—from silky watercolor washes to jagged oil‑knife streaks. Stream those parameters straight into a diffusion model’s prompt embeddings so each frame is literally co‑authored by the dyad’s nervous systems. If you feed your modular’s CV output into the same control channel (say, envelope follower on a heartbeat‑like bass line) the visuals and sound start breathing together—psycho‑physiological synesthesia on a 4090, all in real time.
